## Abstract
Sign language is an important means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. This research paper presents the inception and evolution of "Project Sign Language Detection," designed to ameliorate the communication barriers between the hearing and deaf communities. Using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the research aims to recognize and categorize hand motions that correspond to sign language statements. The study explains the core components, implementation complexities, potential benefits, and areas for additional investigation within this novel endeavor.
